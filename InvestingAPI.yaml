        An `International Securities Identification Number` (ISIN) uniquely
        identifies a security. Its structure is defined in ISO 6166.

        It is a 12 or 14 character alphanumeric code.  It serves for uniform
        identification of a security through normalization of the assigned
        National Number, where one exists, at trading and settlement.

        An ISIN is structured according to the following rules

        1. It is combination of digits and alphabets and may include hyphen(-).

        2. If ISIN contains a hyphen (-) then its length must 14; otherwise 12.

        3. ISIN code must start with an alphabet.

        4. It must end with a digit.

        5. It must not contain white spaces.

        6. Except for the hypen symbol (-), it must not contain any special
        characters.

    instrumentCUSIP:
      description: >
        CUSIP stands for `Committee on Uniform Securities Identification
        Procedures`.

        A CUSIP number identifies most financial instruments, including: stocks
        of all registered U.S. and Canadian companies, commercial paper, and
        U.S. government and municipal bonds.

        The CUSIP system facilitates the clearance and settlement process of
        securities.

        CUSIP numbers consist of nine characters (including letters and numbers)
        that uniquely identify a company or issuer and the type of financial
        instrument.

        A similar system is used to identify foreign securities (`CUSIP
        International Numbering System or CINS`).

        CINS employs the same nine character identifier as CUSIP, but also
        contains a letter in the first position to signify the issuer's country
        or geographic region.
